<!-- MY JOURNEY SECTION -->

  <h2>My Journey</h2>

  <p>
    I am most proud of the journey I've taken from a challenging background to building
    a strong educational foundation and a meaningful career path. Coming from a poor
    family where my parents were not educated, my first major achievement was becoming
    the <strong>school topper in 10th grade across four schools</strong>. That experience
    showed me that determination and hard work can overcome any circumstance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went on to complete my <strong>B.Tech in Engineering</strong>, fulfilling a long-term
    goal I had set for myself. When the Y2K crisis impacted campus placements, I adapted
    by developing strong teaching skills and working as a teacher. This strengthened my
    communication, patience, leadership, and confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    After moving to the United States, I worked as a cashier and customer service associate,
    applying those same communication and teaching skills to connect with customers and
    business contractors. Within one year, I earned both the
    <strong>Bravery & Courage Award</strong> and the
    <strong>Best Cashier Award</strong>, recognizing my work ethic and ability to learn
    new systems quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    My curiosity about technology grew while working with retail software systems daily.
    Wanting to understand how software works behind the scenes, I independently learned
    <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong> and am now actively developing skills
    in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>. This reflects my continuous
    learning mindset, adaptability, and commitment to a career in technology.
